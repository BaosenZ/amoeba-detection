        "We congratulate on you to finish the previous practice and have understanding of python basics, machine learning and image classification. And we welcome you to this level that is about object detection with machine learning. \n",
        "\n",
        "This is a quick and good start and intro to using the pre-trained model to detect objects. And the code (more example can be found on the same source) is from the Mask R-CNN github: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/tree/master/samples. The enviroment is built up in this Notebook and the code can be directly running. \n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook shows how to train Mask R-CNN on your own dataset. To keep things simple we use a synthetic dataset of shapes (squares, triangles, and circles) which enables fast training. You'd still need a GPU, though, because the network backbone is a Resnet101, which would be too slow to train on a CPU. On a GPU, you can start to get okay-ish results in a few minutes, and good results in less than an hour.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code of the *Shapes* dataset is included below. It generates images on the fly, so it doesn't require downloading any data. And it can generate images of any size, so we pick a small image size to train faster. "
